### ***Description:***
This is the first real program I've written for the world. <br>
Hello World! <br>
This was intended to be a copy of Checkers. It has morphed into another game. It will be set up to accept player input from the same PC through mouse input, alternating players after each turn is complete.
This file accurately portrays my coding skill after one month of learning. 

### ***Technologies Used:***
1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Surge
5. VSCode 

### ***Getting Started***
 Below is a link to a hosted version of this file.<br>
[Here](https://frightening-mountain.surge.sh/) <br>
The game only properly loads when the window is ~850px by 500px. Next release will fix this bug.
### ***Screenshots:***
Below is an image of the hosted game.
